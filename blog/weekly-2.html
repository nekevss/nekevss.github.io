<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-center my-8">Where to begin?</h2>
<p class="my-6">So the past month went by WAY faster than intended. Partially because I was hellbent on
on finishing the <code class="bg-theme rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Temporal</code> branch I had been working on so that it could be
relatively mergeable. Once I saw the diff and was able to take more of a 10,000 foot
view, the bumps became pretty clear. As a result, there was more polishing (not to mention
the feedback related changes). so I was pretty focused.</p>
<p class="my-6">I was also able to spend a little more time fixing Foggy Forest and putting together
another Autumn theme. I may actually publish them. I've been using Foggy Forest pretty
routinely, and I honestly really like it. Maybe some other people out there might enjoy
it just as much.</p>
<p class="my-6">No further progress on the Debugger, but there's some ideas I have brewing (halloween pun not
intended). I may put the project on the backburner for now though at least until there's
a little bit more feedback on the PR.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-center my-8">Looking forward</h2>
<p class="my-6">I've actually come across a couple things over the course of my blogging absence that I actually
think I want to write about a bit more, so hopefully there will be more technical posts up soon.</p>
<p class="my-6">But this next month is also starting to look pretty busy.</p>
<p class="my-6">First and foremost, the initial <code class="bg-theme rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Temporal</code> work is relatively close to merging. Once merged,
I want to pick up the pace of work in smaller, more approachable chunks with my personal
goal right now being one PR a week. So that will probably be a mad dash to build out the
other parts.</p>
<p class="my-6">Aside from working on <code class="bg-theme rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Temporal</code>, Svelte 5 genuinely looks good, and I really want to try to
build something.</p>
<p class="my-6">This site has been switched to Foggy Forest, but I'd really like to provide a toggle that
will allow any visitors to theme the site as they like.</p>
<p class="my-6">I've also really been feeling like diving into some Assembly and Zig if I get the time.</p>
<p class="my-6">My hope is to get to as many of these as possible.</p>
<p class="my-6">But that will remain to be seen.</p>
<p class="my-6">Until next time! :D</p></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"meta":{"title":"So it's been a while","date":"10/4/2023","summary":"Weekly update...a month delayed"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eSo, about that commitment to writing weekly...that went a bit out the door, didn't it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere to begin?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the past month went by WAY faster than intended.
