summary: Weekly update...a month delayed

So, about that commitment to writing weekly...that went a bit out the door, didn't it?

## Where to begin?

So the past month went by WAY faster than intended. Partially because I was hellbent on
on finishing the `Temporal` branch I had been working on so that it could be
relatively mergeable. Once I saw the diff and was able to take more of a 10,000 foot
view, the bumps became pretty clear. As a result, there was more polishing (not to mention
the feedback related changes). so I was pretty focused.

I was also able to spend a little more time fixing Foggy Forest and putting together
another Autumn theme. I may actually publish them. I've been using Foggy Forest pretty
routinely, and I honestly really like it. Maybe some other people out there might enjoy
it just as much.

No further progress on the Debugger, but there's some ideas I have brewing (halloween pun not
intended). I may put the project on the backburner for now though at least until there's
a little bit more feedback on the PR.

## Looking forward

I've actually come across a couple things over the course of my blogging absence that I actually
think I want to write about a bit more, so hopefully there will be more technical posts up soon.

But this next month is also starting to look pretty busy.

First and foremost, the initial `Temporal` work is relatively close to merging. Once merged,
I want to pick up the pace of work in smaller, more approachable chunks with my personal
goal right now being one PR a week. So that will probably be a mad dash to build out the
other parts.

Aside from working on `Temporal`, Svelte 5 genuinely looks good, and I really want to try to
build something.

This site has been switched to Foggy Forest, but I'd really like to provide a toggle that
will allow any visitors to theme the site as they like.

I've also really been feeling like diving into some Assembly and Zig if I get the time.

My hope is to get to as many of these as possible.

But that will remain to be seen.

Until next time! :D
