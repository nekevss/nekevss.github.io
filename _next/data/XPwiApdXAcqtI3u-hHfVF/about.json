{"pageProps":{"content":"<h1>About me</h1>\n<p>I am a mostly self-taught programmer/software developer, who enjoys identifying and developing solutions to issues or problems.</p>\n<h2>Technical Background Overview</h2>\n<p>My technical background began in High School where I took engineering course work through Project Lead the Way for all 4 years\nand eventually into college where I was first exposed to programming in C. However, as much as I enjoyed programming at the\ntime, I decided to pursue a BA and MA instead.</p>\n<p>In the later half of 2018, during my MA and due to my previous background, I decided to pick up programming to wire frame a\npotential new site for the job I was currently working. While working on this, I really began to enjoy programming and decided\nto learn more about both JavaScript and Python.</p>\n<p>In 2019, while working my first job out of graduate school, I noticed some processes that could be improved with automation using\nVBA, so I began creating some small tools to automate tasks and/or easy parts of processes at work (some of which are used to\nvarious degrees today).</p>\n<p>The tools themselves grew more robust and shifted from VBA to vanilla JavaScript until one in particular, the <code>productcontentapp</code>,\nneeded a more formal framework. So in 2020, during Covid19, the application itself was then completely rebuilt with Electron, Reactjs and\nSass into the project as it mostly exists today (minus some maintanence and bug fixes over the last four years).</p>\n<p>Around this time, I also began learning Rust and using it on small personal projects until I made my first open source contribution\nto <code>Boa</code> in October 2021 followed shortly by another.</p>\n<p>Since then, I've been working on learning more Rust and helping make contributions to <code>Boa</code>.</p>\n<p>Most recently, I've been working on implementing the new <code>Temporal</code> builtin specification for <code>Boa</code>.</p>"},"__N_SSG":true}
