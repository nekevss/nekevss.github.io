# About me

I am an open-source software engineer with 4+ years of experience developing production applications for my
current role and contributing to open-source projects and over a year experience as an open-source maintainer. 
I enjoy identifying issues or areas of improvement and developing solutions to address those areas.

## Background Overview

My technical background began in High School where I took engineering course work through Project Lead the Way for all 4 years
and eventually into college where I was first exposed to programming with a introduction class to C. A few years later in 2018,
this background would help when I decided to wireframe a potential new site design for my then job.

In 2019, while working my first job out of graduate school, I noticed some processes that could be improved with automation, so
I began creating some small tools to automate tasks and/or easy parts of processes at work (some of which are used to various
degrees today).

These tools grew more robust until I created my main project for that role, the `productcontentdesktopapp`, which functions
as a staging area/mini CMS for the operations team. The application itself has a few interfaces for interacting with content
and an content engine that can generate content based off product attributes. I would continue to develop and maintain this
project for the next four years.

Around 2020, I also began learning Rust and using it on small personal projects until I made my first open source contribution
to `Boa` in October 2021 followed shortly by another.

Since then, I've been working on learning more Rust and helping make contributions to `Boa`.

Most recently, I've been working on implementing the new `Temporal` builtin specification for `Boa`.

# More about me

I like hiking, games (board and video), books and movies, and programming. Always enjoy going out and enjoying nature / the world.
