<p class="my-6">I am an open-source software engineer with 4+ years of experience developing production applications for my
current role and contributing to open-source projects and over a year experience as an open-source maintainer.
I enjoy identifying issues or areas of improvement and developing solutions to address those areas.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-center my-8">Background Overview</h2>
<p class="my-6">My technical background began in High School where I took engineering course work through Project Lead the Way for all 4 years
and eventually into college where I was first exposed to programming with a introduction class to C. A few years later in 2018,
this background would help when I decided to wireframe a potential new site design for my then job.</p>
<p class="my-6">In 2019, while working my first job out of graduate school, I noticed some processes that could be improved with automation, so
I began creating some small tools to automate tasks and/or easy parts of processes at work (some of which are used to various
degrees today).</p>
<p class="my-6">These tools grew more robust until I created my main project for that role, the <code class="bg-theme overflow-x-auto rounded-sm font-mono px-1">productcontentdesktopapp</code>, which functions
as a staging area/mini CMS for the operations team. The application itself has a few interfaces for interacting with content
and an content engine that can generate content based off product attributes. I would continue to develop and maintain this
project for the next four years.</p>
<p class="my-6">Around 2020, I also began learning Rust and using it on small personal projects until I made my first open source contribution
to <code class="bg-theme overflow-x-auto rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Boa</code> in October 2021 followed shortly by another.</p>
<p class="my-6">Since then, I've been working on learning more Rust and helping make contributions to <code class="bg-theme overflow-x-auto rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Boa</code>.</p>
<p class="my-6">Most recently, I've been working on implementing the new <code class="bg-theme overflow-x-auto rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Temporal</code> builtin specification for <code class="bg-theme overflow-x-auto rounded-sm font-mono px-1">Boa</code>.</p>
<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center my-8">More about me</h1>
<p class="my-6">I like hiking, games (board and video), books and movies, and programming. Always enjoy going out and enjoying nature / the world.</p></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"\u003ch1\u003eAbout me\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am an open-source software engineer with 4+ years of experience developing production applications for my\ncurrent role and contributing to open-source projects and over a year experience as an open-source maintainer.\nI enjoy identifying issues or areas of improvement and developing solutions to address those areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBackground Overview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy technical background began in High School where I took engineering course work through Project Lead the Way for all 4 years\nand eventually into college where I was first exposed to programming with a introduction class to C.
